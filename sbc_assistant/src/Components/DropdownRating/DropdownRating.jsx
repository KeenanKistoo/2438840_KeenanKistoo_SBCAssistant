/* The basic structure was used from Jacob Broughton's YouTube Video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb70Epml9X0).
    This video was useful to give my dropdown basic functionality, however it did not use props. I had to alter the
    code to ensure that all my inputs/outputs were available to use in the assistant instead of having to constantly
    cross reference values. 

    I have chosen to not use a context system for this. The only two aspects which are affected are the two dropdown
    components and the assistants. I felt that props were efficient enough to control this.
