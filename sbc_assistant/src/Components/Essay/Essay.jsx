      <h1>The Wilderness Machine: An Interactive Film by Chris Milk</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Choice of Case Study:</strong> The Wilderness Machine: An interactive film by Chris Milk that was built using HTML5 for Arcade Fire’s music video of We Used To Wait: The Wilderness Downtown (Milk et al., 2010). To experience The Wilderness Machine: <a href="http://www.thewildernessdowntown.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.thewildernessdowntown.com/</a>. YouTube Video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReIwYj7BACM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReIwYj7BACM</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        An interactive film, like the interactive video, merges elements of classic cinema with input systems typically used in video games. These input methods can include controllers, a mouse and keyboard, joysticks, and other hardware-specific devices. Arcade Fire's interactive music video uses a mouse and keyboard for its input system, reflecting its browser-based nature. This design choice is consistent with its specific compatibility with web browsers like Google Chrome, allowing users to interact with the content through conventional web-based navigation methods (scrolling, clicking, typing, etc.). These input mechanisms facilitate the personalized and interactive experience for which "The Wilderness Downtown" is known for (Milk et al., 2010).

      <h2>Defining Art</h2>
      <p>
        My understanding of what art is, is the representation of an idea, thought, emotion, concept, or space in a medium that is believed to be aesthetically pleasing to a specific audience. Artists use various story-telling elements, that their medium allows, to communicate their message to the audience. For example, in a play, an actor will breathe heavily and slouch over in an exaggerated manner to show that they are tired, or in a comic, an artist might depict a character with a cloud over their head and a frown to visually illustrate sadness. Simply speaking, art is another form of communication.
      </p>
      <h2>Defining Internet Art</h2>
      <p>
        Internet art, similarly, is the use of internet’s affordances to display data in a specific manner on the world-wide-web. For example, an internet artist might create an interactive website that allows users to explore a virtual environment, where each click or interaction reveals hidden images, stories, or sounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        A key feature and affordance of internet art is interactivity. Interactivity allows users to participate in the artwork and creates an environment for a more personalised experience, which will further be discussed in the analysis of "The Wilderness Downtown" (Milk et al., 2010).
      </p>
      <h2>Defining Cinema</h2>
      <p>
        Cinema traditionally refers to "feature-length films that are created to be shown in the theatre" (Matt, n.d.). However, modern streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime have revolutionized how we consume films. They allow audiences to watch full-length films on various devices, including mobile phones and televisions, without the need to visit a theatre (Matt, n.d.). This shift has made movie viewing more accessible and convenient, enabling people to enjoy cinema from the comfort of their own homes. While being substantially more accessible can be beneficial for consumers, it also drastically increases the competition within the industry itself.
      </p>
      <h2>Google’s Influence and Participation in "The Wilderness Downtown" (Milk et al., 2010)</h2>
      <p>
        Arcade Fire's interactive music video is designed to be viewed in a web browser, with a specific focus on Google Chrome. This timing is significant, as Chrome was released around two years prior to the interactive video, and Google partnered with the band Arcade Fire and director Chris Milk to create it (Milk et al., 2010). Given that Chrome was still relatively new, and its front-end capabilities were strictly based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the music video was groundbreaking. Considering Google's involvement in the design process, it's likely that accessing and manipulating Google Earth data was more seamless due to the collaboration between the teams responsible for both the browser and the music video's production. This partnership enabled the smooth integration of location-based imagery and the personalized elements that made the music video unique. Consumer trust is another advantage of creating an interactive experience with Google Chrome. "The Wilderness Downtown" music video, for example, requires permission to open pop-up windows, which is justifiably frowned upon by the internet users, due to potential security risks. However, because the music video is associated with a trusted platform like Google Chrome, users are more likely to allow pop-ups.

      <h2>Analysis of "The Wilderness Downtown" (Milk et al., 2010)</h2>
      <p>
        For the purpose of this assignment, it is important to note that my focus is not on interactive film as a medium, but rather the effect this medium and music video has on the audience, and how it is utilized Google Earth’s capabilities to create a more personal and involved experience for each user that interacts with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you would have gathered by now, “The Wilderness Downtown” is an internet, specifically, a browser-based artwork that takes the form of an interactive music video. This interactive experience is built around the song: We Used To Wait: The Wilderness Downtown by Arcade Fire (Arcade Fire, 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon entering the website, there are two forms of interactivity: 1) the user is prompted to enter an address of a place from their childhood; 2) the user can move their cursor towards the birds which will try to avoid it. This gives the user an idea of what sort of interactions they can expect through the interactive experience. The address that is entered, will act as the setting for the rest of the music video.
      </p>
      <p>
        The general theme of the song itself is surrounded around nostalgia, reflection, and realisation. The lyrics discuss a rapid change in events in the artists life and reminisce of how things were when they were children, hence, the website prompting for a childhood address.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the music video, there is a person wearing a hoodie and their face or identity is never revealed. This plays a fundamental role as it allows the user to place themselves in the character’s position. If the identity or any characteristics of the hooded character is ever revealed, it takes away from the personal experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shortly into the video, a pop-up window opens, and there are birds in an orangish sky setting. The birds’ reaction, to the cursor is identical to that of the birds in the opening page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the map of the address inputted is displayed in a window, you will notice a silhouette of a person running across the map. In relation to this, the hooded character is running down their own street allowing the user to place themselves in what they would believe it would feel like to run down the addressed place again. The pacing of the individual running is like the pacing of the music as well which enhances the experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another effective method to direct the user's focus occurs when repetitive lyrics, such as the chorus, are played. During these moments, the map transitions to a first-person perspective, immersing the viewer more deeply into the visual narrative. This shift in perspective aligns with the repetitive elements of the music, creating a more engaging and captivating experience. When the focus shifts to the song's lyrics, the hooded character is shown simply running through various scenes, evoking the feel of a more traditional music video. This approach allows the viewer to concentrate on the song's words while the visual narrative takes on a more familiar structure, reinforcing the song's emotional context without complex interactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        What makes this internet artwork unique is its approach to involving the user at the centre of the piece while creating a sense of nostalgia. Instead of giving users complete control, it simulates an experience by guiding them through a predetermined journey. This design choice allows users to relive memories without dictating every aspect of the interaction, creating a balance between modern internet-based interactivity and traditional cinematic narrative-driven storytelling.
      </p>
      <p>
        A downside to this piece is that Google Earth was updated in 2023, which affected the experience slightly. When I first explored this artwork, Google Earth's imagery had remained static for some time, allowing me to revisit a location from my childhood that looked familiar, but not as it is now. The changes from the recent update made the neighbourhood appear as it did in 2023, disrupting the nostalgic aspect of the experience. This is one of the disadvantages of internet art. Since technology is constantly evolving, internet artists must continually update and adapt their work to keep it relevant and true to the original vision.
      </p>
      <p>
        This ongoing need for maintenance and modification adds complexity to the creation and this constant evolution of technology poses a significant challenge for artists working in the digital realm. To maintain the impact and relevance of their artwork, they often must respond to software updates, changes in platform compatibility, and evolving web standards. This need for ongoing adaptation can be resource-intensive and time-consuming. Consequently, the sustainability of internet-based artworks is a critical consideration, requiring artists to balance their creative intentions with the practical demands of technology maintenance. While these challenges are significant, they also present opportunities for artists to innovate and evolve their practice in response to the changing digital landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, despite this challenge, the interactive experience remains a testament to the potential of internet art. It demonstrates how combining music, film, and technology can create a deeply personal and engaging experience that resonates on an emotional level. The collaboration between Arcade Fire, Chris Milk, and Google serves as a pioneering example of how internet art can harness technological advancements to deliver a unique, memorable experience.
